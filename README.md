# 🐍 Python OOP Project – Class Design & Polymorphism
Welcome to the **Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project! This repository contains a hands-on exploration of OOP concepts such as class design, constructors, inheritance, and polymorphism using creative examples.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project includes:
- A custom class design (`Smartphone`, `Book`, or `Superhero`).
- Implementation of object attributes and methods.
- Use of constructors to initialize object data.
- Demonstration of inheritance and polymorphism using a **Polymorphism Challenge** with animals or vehicles.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Class Creation
- Custom classes with attributes and methods.
- Encapsulation using getters and setters.

### ✅ Constructors
- Initialize objects with unique values using `__init__`.

### ✅ Inheritance
- Base class and derived classes to show reusability of code.

### ✅ Polymorphism
- Different classes sharing a method name but with different behavior.
  - Example: 
    - `Car.move()` → `🚗 Driving`
    - `Plane.move()` → `✈️ Flying`
    - `Boat.move()` → `⛵ Sailing`
